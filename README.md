A lightweight web application that allows users to track their daily mood through emoji-based selection and personal notes. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, the project demonstrates fundamental concepts of client-side web development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic rendering of user-generated content.
